## About Wordle

Wordle is a very popular word-based game. The goal of the game is to guess a word with 5 letters from predefined dictionary in 6 guesses in as little tries as possible.

After each guess, the game shows you for every letter
in your guess, if that character is on the correct position (result is _correct_), is in the word but on another position (result is _present_), or is not in the word at all (result is _absent_).

## Algorithm

Steldrow is a completely deterministic algorithm. It is initialized with two lists of words,
the common and uncommon ones. These word lists are taken from Wordle page source code and are defined in [wordlist.js](src/wordlist.js).

Then, for each round, the following is performed:

1. From the common words, a character frequency is calculated, counting all occurences of the same character inside one word as one occurence (e.g. both "eerie" and "taken" add 1 to frequency of character "e").
2. Words are sorted by their character frequencies. The scoring function takes a set of characters in a word and sums their precalculated frequencies. Words are then sorted from highest to lowest score.
3. The first word is taken from the sorted list and used as a guess.
4. If the word was correct, the algorithm stops.
5. Otherwise, both common and uncommon words are filtered based on the result obtained. Filtering function removes the words that

   - do not have _correct_ characters on proper indices,
   - have _present_ characters on the same index as the guess word,
   - do not contain _present_ characters at all,
   - contain the _absent_ characters.

6. If filtered common word list is empty, it is replaces by uncommon word list (that has also been filtered on every step).
